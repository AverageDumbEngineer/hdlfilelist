## HDLFileList extension.
Provides simple functionality for .f HDL source files lists:
- syntax highlighting for file paths
- smart suggestions based on the file structure
- simple error checking for path correctness
- ability to go to a file, specified in the path from the file list directly

Other functionality is not yet planned, but if you want anything, let me know.
